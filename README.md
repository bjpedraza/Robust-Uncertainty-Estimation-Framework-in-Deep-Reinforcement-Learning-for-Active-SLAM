# Robust-Uncertainty-Estimation-Framework-in-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Active-SLAM
This repository contains work on deep reinforcement learning for a TurtleBot robot using a custom-proposed architecture called Bayesian A2C. The project utilized the Gazebo simulator and an open-source OpenAI gym extension named gym-gazebo. It was constructed using the Linux OS, TensorFlow, and the Robot Operating System (ROS).


## Journal Article
This project's **full** paper is currently in the process of being submitted for the public by ProQuest, as well as another publisher. 

While a shorter version of the project's idea was already submitted through the IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI) 2023, the **extended** version is set to be published publicly later this year in **2024**.

However, for now the shorter version can be found and read on the ieeexplore website and can be accessed at [Robust Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Based on Bayesian Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195002).
