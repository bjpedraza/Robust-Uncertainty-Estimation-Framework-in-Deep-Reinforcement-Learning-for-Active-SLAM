# Robust-Uncertainty-Estimation-Framework-in-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Active-SLAM
This repository consists of deep reinforming learning on a TurtleBot robot using a custom-proposed architecture known as Bayesian A2C. The project utilized the Gazebo simulator and an open-source OpenAI gym extension called gym-gazebo. The project was constructed using the Linux OS, TensorFlow, and the Robot Operating System (ROS).
